PyPoll.Main.py and Main.py both create a path to the csv file being analyzed, read the file, store the header, and loop through the rest of the data, pulling out the information that we need to look at. 

One of the tutors helped me with a lot of the code needed for the PyBank assignment and then I based my PyPoll assignment on a lot of the work I had already done for PyBank, though of course the coding is a bit different in places. 

After the programs gathered all the data, I put them into an f-string to be output to a text file.
